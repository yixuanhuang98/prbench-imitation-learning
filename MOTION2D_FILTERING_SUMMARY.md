# Motion2D State and Action Space Filtering

## Overview
This document summarizes the modifications made to filter the state and action spaces for Motion2D environments in the imitation learning pipeline.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Space Filtering
**Original:** 19-dimensional observation vector containing all object features
**Filtered:** 7-dimensional observation vector containing only essential components

#### Filtered Components:
- **Robot pose (3D):** indices 0-2 (x, y, theta)
- **Target position (2D):** indices 9-10 (x, y)  
- **Target dimensions (2D):** indices 17-18 (width, height)

#### Removed Components:
- Robot physical properties (base_radius, arm_joint, arm_length, vacuum, gripper_height, gripper_width)
- Target visual/static properties (theta, static, color_r, color_g, color_b, z_order)

### 2. Action Space Filtering
**Original:** 5-dimensional action vector (dx, dy, dtheta, darm, vacuum)
**Filtered:** 3-dimensional action vector (dx, dy, dtheta)

#### Filtered Components:
- **Movement actions:** dx, dy, dtheta (indices 0-2)

#### Removed Components:
- Arm extension (darm)
- Vacuum control (vacuum)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. **`scripts/run_diffusion_pipeline.py`**
   - Added `_filter_motion2d_observation()` and `_filter_motion2d_action()` functions
   - Modified expert demonstration collection to apply filtering
   - Modified precomputed demonstration loading to apply filtering

2. **`src/prbench_imitation_learning/data_generation.py`**
   - Added filtering functions
   - Modified `create_dataset_features()` to handle filtered dimensions
   - Modified `convert_trajectory_to_dataset_format()` to apply filtering
   - Updated `generate_lerobot_dataset()` to detect motion2d environments

3. **`src/prbench_imitation_learning/evaluate.py`**
   - Added filtering functions
   - Modified `PolicyEvaluator` class to detect motion2d environments
   - Modified `predict_action()` to filter observations and expand actions back to full space

### Key Functions:

```python
def _filter_motion2d_observation(obs: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Filter 19D observation to 7D essential components."""
    if len(obs) >= 19:
        essential_indices = [0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 17, 18]
        return obs[essential_indices].astype(np.float32)
    else:
        return obs.astype(np.float32)

def _filter_motion2d_action(action: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Filter 5D action to 3D movement components."""
    if len(action) >= 3:
        return action[:3].astype(np.float32)
    else:
        return action.astype(np.float32)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity:** 19D → 7D state space reduces model complexity
2. **Focus on Essential Information:** Only navigation-relevant features retained
3. **Improved Learning Efficiency:** Smaller observation space should improve sample efficiency
4. **Motion-Focused:** Removes irrelevant arm and vacuum controls for navigation tasks

## Usage

The filtering is automatically applied when using motion2d environments. The pipeline automatically detects motion2d environments by checking if "motion2d" appears in the environment name.

### Example:
```bash
python run_diffusion_pipeline.py --env motion2d-p0 --data-type expert --data-episodes 10
```

This will automatically:
- Filter observations from 19D to 7D during data collection
- Train models with 7D observations and 3D actions  
- Filter observations and expand actions during evaluation

## Verification

The implementation was tested with:
- Expert demonstration collection ✅
- Model training with filtered data ✅
- Policy evaluation with filtering ✅
- End-to-end pipeline execution ✅

The pipeline successfully runs on motion2d-p0 with the new filtering, producing:
- **Dataset:** 7D observations, 3D actions
- **Training:** Model expects 7D input, 3D output
- **Evaluation:** Automatic filtering/expansion for compatibility

## Future Extensions

The filtering approach can be extended to other environments by:
1. Adding environment detection logic
2. Defining essential state components for each environment type
3. Implementing corresponding filtering functions

This provides a clean, modular approach to reducing state/action complexity for specific environments while maintaining full compatibility with the existing pipeline.
